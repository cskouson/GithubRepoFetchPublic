This webapp allows you to retrieve various github repo information for any user.

After entering a username the table will show the first two public repos for this
user.  Each item will have a branches button which will add a list below the table
with the names, sha, url, and protected status for each branch of that repo.

Addtionally, there is a dropdown that lets you add additional repos to the table.
